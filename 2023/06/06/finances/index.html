href=#apps class="hash g">#</a></h2><p>By now, I&rsquo;ve used four apps to track and manage my finances.</p><ul><li><a href=https://mint.intuit.com/>Mint</a></li><li><a href=https://copilot.money/>Copilot</a></li><li><a href=https://lunchmoney.app/>Lunch Money</a></li><li><a href=https://www.monarchmoney.com/referral/m80icel1cq>Monarch Money</a></li></ul><p>Enough has been said about Mint. I used it because it was free. I left because the ads were annoying. I started using Copilot because it was beautiful and I&rsquo;d gained appreciation for good software, enough to start paying for it. I used Lunch Money while using Copilot because I thought I wanted a stronger budgeting, category, and <a href=https://lunchmoney.app/features/analytics>query</a> system. Lunch Money is by far the best of them all at delivering <a href=https://lunchmoney.app/features/stats-trends>analytics and insights</a>.</p><h2 id=monarch>Monarch <a href=#monarch class="hash g">#</a></h2><p>This brings me to the current app I use for tracking my finances, Monarch. I switched from Copilot because I wanted better desktop support. The same month I switched, Copilot released a desktop version of their app&mldr; That being said, I <em>like</em> that Monarch&rsquo;s mobile app has less information, less cluttered, and the desktop app has more information, evenly spaced. I also think Monarch&rsquo;s <a href=https://www.monarchmoney.com/features/recurring>recurring feature</a> is more intuitive. The calendar view is great for visualizing when exactly I get paid, when exactly I pay my Con-Ed and insurance bills. My main gripe with this feature is that you mark a merchant as recurring. That doesn&rsquo;t make sense for some merchants that offer both recurring and one-time products, like my Apple iCloud and TV bills are recurring but my one-time in-app purchase is not.</p><p>My favorite view is the <a href=https://www.monarchmoney.com/features/spending>cash flow view</a>, which shows:</p><ul><li>Expenses and income broken down by category, sorted by amount</li><li>Total sum of income</li><li>Total sum of expenses</li><li>How this month&rsquo;s total income and expenses compare to the past 10 months</li></ul><p>I find most apps take the budgeting approach to visualizing expenses, but I think there are two questions at hand here.</p><ol><li>How much money did you earn/spend?</li><li>How does that map to your budget?</li></ol><p>Most apps treat these as the same question. I like that Monarch treats them as two. It matches how I think about my finances.</p><h2 id=analytics>Analytics <a href=#analytics class="hash g">#</a></h2><p>This post was inspired by this tweet I saw. Someone was like, &ldquo;someone should build ChatGPT for Mint&rdquo; (something along those lines, not a direct quote). Their point was like, you should be able to ask &ldquo;How much did I spend on restaurants in January?&rdquo; and get a response.</p><p>My initial reaction is I don&rsquo;t think anybody would use it. I think people who already care enough to ask that question are using Mint, YNAB, or some other app that enables you to answer those kinds of questions already. In my case, I can filter transactions to Restaurants, set the date range to Jan 1-31, and Monarch sums the total for me. I can also download a CSV of all the transactions. I basically think the spreadsheet crew isn&rsquo;t going to see value in &ldquo;ChatGPT for finances&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s already low friction for them to answer the questions they have.</p><p>I could be proven wrong here. To be honest, I thought the same about SQL. I thought nobody would ever adopt &ldquo;ChatGPT for data analytics&rdquo; because, in my mind, SQL isn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> hard to write. I mean, SQL is hard to write, yes, but I thought people would adopt query-writing helpers rather than completely replacing their workflow with natural language. I&rsquo;m biased here because the company I work at has a big SQL-writing culture. Everyone I interact with, both engineers and non-engineers, has quite good SQL knowledge. At work, it&rsquo;s a thing you learn if you don&rsquo;t know it. Ultimately, both the SQL replacements and SQL helpers will probably have their place, although it&rsquo;s still early.</p><h2 id=some-transactions>Some transactions <a href=#some-transactions class="hash g">#</a></h2><p>Another problem is people don&rsquo;t know what questions they should be asking about their finances. I think that&rsquo;s more along the lines of a personalized financial advisor (person or robot).</p><p>Anyways, here are the answers to some random questions I came up with.</p><ul><li>The largest restaurant transaction ever charged to me was at <a href=https://resy.com/cities/ny/oxomoco>Oxomoco</a> for a group of 5.</li><li>The most I ever spent in a single transaction at a coffee shop was $21.83 on November 12, 2022 at <a href=https://www.textbook.nyc/>Textbook</a></li><li>From September 27, 2021 to April 7, 2023, $404.16 in wine transactions were charged to my card (also much of it paid back via Venmo. I&rsquo;m too lazy to properly map Venmo transactions to the original card transaction). One of these transactions is <a href=http://www.californiawinemerchant.com/>California Wine Merchant</a> in the Marina in SF.</li></ul><div class=m><span>Tags |</span>
