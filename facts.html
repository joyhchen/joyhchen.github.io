                <p class="text-left">A majority of the waste produced in America is recyclable, but only 30% of recyclable American waste is recycled. Our chief goal is to make more people aware of the hard facts about recycling. We are damaging our planet, and the first step to mending our relationship with the land we walk on is educating ourselves. If we can't understand why we are hurting the world, we can't move towards fixing it. This page serves as an overview of the solid facts about recycling. For more in-depth explanations, the subpages under "The Facts" are available for reading.

                <p class="text-left">We hear about the damage we are doing to the world on television, but it's often difficult to imagine how we can contribute. However, if American recycling levels reach 75%, the environmental impact will be akin to removing over 50 million cars off the road, and you can be part of that 75%. </p>

                <p class="text-left">In 2009, Americans produced enough trash to go around the world 24 times. Startling facts like these are a reminder that better education about recycling needs to spread to the general public. Together, we can educate others and spread the word.</p>

            <div class="large-12 columns">
                <p class="text-left">Waste negatively impacts the environment because of the chemicals and greenhouse gases that landfills release. Ultimately, these harmful substances lead to the destruction of the environment. Additionally, the energy required when making products out of raw materials is much larger than the energy required when making products out of recycled materials, reducing the negative effects on the environment.

                <p class="text-left">It is also increasingly difficult for us to manage the amount of waste we have on our planet. As our landfills grow bigger, the amount of space we have on our planet does not. Recycling can reduce the amount of trash that fills up our landfills and in doing so also ensure our children have enough natural resources in the future.

                <p class="text-left">Governmental and environmental protection agencies have made it their priority to reduce the rate at which we are filling up our landfills, but it is increasingly difficult as we enter an age where many products are not biodegradable. Not only is it important to inform others about recycling, it is absolutely essential that current and future generations know their impact on the world.

            <div class="large-12 columns">
                <p class="text-left">Recycling can be more than just tossing your items in the recycling bin, it can also be about reusing your items and reducing your consumption. To recycle, the most common way is to find a bin, but you can also recycle various other items such as computers. You can search for a recycling center near you that collects what you need to recycle at <a href="http://search.earth911.com/">http://search.earth911.com/</a>.

        </div>
        <div class="row container">
            <div class="large-12 columns">
                <p class="text-left">Reusing your items also reduces the amount of trash in the world. Instead of throwing away your child's old shirt, consider donating it to another family. Do you need to package something? Instead of going to the store and buying new materials, check if you have newspapers or bubble wrap from the last package someone sent you. Have you gotten to the bottle of the jelly jar? You can reuse the jar to store other items. Do you have old grocery bags? You can save these and use them as carrying bags the next time you need to bring an item somewhere. The next time you are about to throw an item away, consider its other uses. Reusing is a way you can benefit the world without having to buy any extra products to help you. You can make an impact just by normally buying groceries.

        <div class="row container">
            <div class="large-12 columns">
                <p class="text-left">By watching what you buy, you can reduce the amount of waste you produce. It starts with only buying essential items that you need. If you don't require a product, consider putting it down to reduce the amount of waste you produce. With the products you do buy, try to stray away from products with heavy packaging. If the product contains chemicals, try to make sure it is non-toxic, and if it is toxic, try to use all of the product to reduce harm on the environment. Finally, constantly try to find safer alternatives with less packaging to reduce the amount of waste produced.

                <p class="text-left">While it is sometimes impossible to do everything we can to recycle, it is not impossible to try our best. Just one simple gesture can positively affect the world, and it starts with changing the attitude that environmental harm is inevitable.
