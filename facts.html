                <p class="text-center text-augment">A majority of the waste produced in America is recyclable, but only 30% of recyclable American waste is recycled. Our chief goal is to make more people aware of the hard facts about recycling. We are damaging our planet, and the first step to mending our relationship with the land we walk on is educating ourselves. If we can't understand why we are hurting the world, we can't move towards fixing it.

However, if American recycling levels reach 75%, the environmental impact will be akin to removing over 50 million cars off the road, and you can be part of that 75%. Think about the possibility of cleaner air, a healthier environment, and better conditions for not only you but also the entire population of the world.</p>

                <p class="text-left">In 2009, Americans produced enough trash to go around the world <strong>24 times</strong>. Startling facts like these are a reminder that better education about recycling needs to spread to the general public. While awareness has come along way, it hasn't been enough so far. Together, we can educate others and spread the word to benefit our environment. It is never too late to make a positive impact, and it's especially important to understand that nurturing the Earth's health is a crucial task that must be undertaken.</p>

Through volunteering, teaching, or even picking up recyclable items yourself, you can make a change. Be proactive. Constantly search for ways to benefit the community. If you're not aware of a recycling program in your area, create one. Being proactive in the process of learning about recycling is just as important as recycling itself. While words are big, the world will not benefit if we do not take action. Check out our pages under the "Help Out" tab to find out more about how you can be proactive.</p>

                <p class="text-left">Reusing your items also reduces the amount of trash in the world. Instead of throwing away your child's old shirt, consider donating it to another family. Do you need to package something? Instead of going to the store and buying new materials, check if you have newspapers or bubble wrap from the last package someone sent you. Have you reached the bottom of the jelly jar? You can reuse the jar to store other items. Do you have old grocery bags? You can save these and use them as carrying bags the next time you need to bring an item somewhere. <strong>The next time you are about to throw an item away, consider its other uses.</strong> Reusing is a way you can benefit the world without having to buy any extra products to help you. You can make an impact just by normally buying groceries.

                <p class="text-left">By watching what you buy, you can reduce the amount of waste you produce. It starts with only buying essential items that you need. If you don't require a product, consider putting it down to reduce the amount of waste you produce. With the products you do buy, try to stray away from products with heavy packaging. If the product contains chemicals, try to make sure it is non-toxic, and if it is toxic, try to use all of the product to reduce harm on the environment. Finally, constantly try to find safer alternatives with less packaging to reduce the amount of waste produced.
