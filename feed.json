Specifcially, we were in between the Physical Sciences Building and Klarman Hall. This was 2018, when Lime Bike was still in Ithaca. We spotted a bike on the sidewalk and decided to use it. If you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with PSB, you know it\u0026rsquo;s on top of a hill, and my friends took turns riding up and down the hill. They came back to the sidewalk and told me it\u0026rsquo;s not that hard to ride a bike, so I gave it a shot (on the sidewalk, not the hill). I was able to steadily ride the bike for, a minute? But, it didn\u0026rsquo;t stick.\nThird attempt # Summer of 2019, I was in Beijing. My friends and I were in Wudaokou, and they wanted to bike to the Bird\u0026rsquo;s Nest. To give you an idea of how long that would take, the distance is around 3 miles or 5 km. I was a little scared, but I figured I could learn along the way. My friends had trouble describing how to ride the bike to me, but if I didn\u0026rsquo;t figure it out, I would have been left behind. I kept trying to \u0026ldquo;balance while moving\u0026rdquo; as someone described it, and eventually I got the hang of it.
