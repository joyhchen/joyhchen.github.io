&lt;p>The story is I was invited because a teammate said I use &lt;em>everything&lt;/em> they build, which is true. As of the writing of this post, I hold the company record for largest stacked PR. Two things are true:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>I love stacked PRs!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I definitely continued adding PRs to my stack even when I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to because I wanted the record.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be long before I lose the record because stacked PR adoption continues to trend up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, I was telling the engineer interviewing me: I think you should interview the teammate who referred me because he&amp;rsquo;s the opposite of me; he doesn&amp;rsquo;t use any of the tools you build. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. He&amp;rsquo;s happy with his workflow, and his productivity is great.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If both of us can be productive, me using &lt;em>everything&lt;/em> you build and him using nothing you build, why even adopt the new tooling?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I came to a simple conclusion. For me, I &lt;em>feel&lt;/em> more productive using the new tooling. &lt;em>How I feel doing my job&lt;/em> affects my job satisfaction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All this is to say I think the investment in developer productivity makes me happier at work, so I greatly appreciate it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That being said, different people are more/less bothered by friction in developer workflows.&lt;/p></description><author>ronalds.vilcins@gmail.com (Ronalds Vilcins)</author><guid>/2023/08/28/devprodjobsat/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 28 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Why write frontend unit tests?</title><link>/2023/08/28/rtltesting/</link><description>&lt;p>At work, a debate that has come up several times is whether it&amp;rsquo;s worth writing frontend unit tests. Here&amp;rsquo;s an overview or our testing setup:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_monitoring">Synthetic monitoring&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unit tests&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>People often ask, if we have the former, why do we need the latter? With the latter, most of the time we&amp;rsquo;re just testing scenarios like:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The text appears when you render the component.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The button click changes the screen.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The tooltip appears on hover.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Why test these simple things at all?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was going through my old internal documents recently, and I came across a doc I wrote on backend testing helpers. In that doc, I link to the &lt;a href="https://blog.nelhage.com/2016/03/design-for-testability/">&amp;ldquo;Design for Testability&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> article.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to say clicked. You should write frontend unit tests because they force you to write isolated components. If you can&amp;rsquo;t test the component easily because you have 5 different if/else statements and multiple data queries, then your component might be too big.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the time, everyone thinks, well I can understand this frontend component, so it&amp;rsquo;s fine. Inevitably, other people add more code to your component, then it balloons into a 1,000 line component nobody can understand. Then you have to account for detangling the thing in your engineering estimate for a business-critical project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s why you should write comprehensive unit tests and isolated components as a forcing mechanism for good behavior/citizenship.&lt;/p></description><author>ronalds.vilcins@gmail.com (Ronalds Vilcins)</author><guid>/2023/08/28/rtltesting/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 28 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>AI automates the boring code</title><link>/2023/06/03/aiautomatestheboringcode/</link><description>&lt;p>Recently, I was thinking about how people learn how to code. &lt;em>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python&lt;/em> is a book frequently recommended to people learning Python. It teaches you the basics of the language and how to do practical tasks. One of the first practical uses I had for writing Python scripts was scraping the used phone marketplace Swappa and emailing myself whenever a new listing was posted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are two true statements about that task.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s precisely the kind of task &lt;em>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python&lt;/em> teaches you to do.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Copilot can automate 70% of it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="ai-automates-the-boring-code">AI automates the boring code &lt;a href="#ai-automates-the-boring-code" class="hash g">#&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In my day job as a full-stack engineer, I would say Copilot only writes 10% of the code I write, and the code it automates is what I call &lt;em>boring code&lt;/em>. Here are some examples of boring code that Copilot can write.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The sleep() function in JavaScript&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Import statements for generated types, API wrapper, and UI library [0]&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The boilerplate code to raise an error&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ruby case statement with conditions already filled out given a &lt;a href="https://sorbet.org/docs/tenum">typed enum&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Syntax things: for loops, if statements, function definitions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.1/">Standard library&lt;/a> functions, especially useful since I work with dates and times a lot&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Here&amp;rsquo;s another claim: Software engineers don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy writing boring code.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recently saw a thread on Twitter claiming an engineer with many years of experience refused to use Copilot because he &amp;ldquo;really enjoys writing code.&amp;rdquo; There&amp;rsquo;re lots of strange threads on AI Twitter, so I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised. In any case, I find it hard to believe someone really enjoys looking up syntax and writing basic for loops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The engineers I know enjoy software engineering because it&amp;rsquo;s about solving problems. Writing code is a way to solve problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Solving problems is the fun part.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="an-example-problem">An example problem &lt;a href="#an-example-problem" class="hash g">#&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Here is a real problem anyone who works for a Big Company can relate to that AI cannot solve [1]. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re doing an internal data model migration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To give a real example, let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re a clothing company that started out selling shirts. Your shirt product is represented in code as the &lt;code>Shirt&lt;/code> model. The &lt;code>Shirt&lt;/code> model has properties on it, like &lt;code>is_short_sleeve&lt;/code>, &lt;code>is_long_sleeve&lt;/code>, &lt;code>is_cropped&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>discount_rate&lt;/code> [2].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, now you want to expand your business, so you decide to clean up this code. You create a new model &lt;code>Product&lt;/code> for the next phase of your business, and you need to write a migration.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Software solves business problems.&lt;/strong> You&amp;rsquo;re in this situation because your code made assumptions about the business that no longer hold true. You&amp;rsquo;re remedying the situation to enable the business to grow.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>AI can&amp;rsquo;t write the migration by itself&lt;/strong>. The fields on the &lt;code>Shirt&lt;/code> model don&amp;rsquo;t map 1:1 with the &lt;code>Product&lt;/code> model. You likely want to represent &lt;code>is_short_sleeve&lt;/code> and &lt;code>is_long_sleeve&lt;/code> differently on the new model. You might not want &lt;code>discount_rate&lt;/code> on the &lt;code>Product&lt;/code> itself; you could have a separate &lt;code>Promotion&lt;/code> model that defines the products included in the promotion.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="ai-helps-solve-problems">AI &lt;em>helps&lt;/em> solve problems &lt;a href="#ai-helps-solve-problems" class="hash g">#&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the example above, thinking about how you&amp;rsquo;re going to represent products for the next phase of your business, and how you&amp;rsquo;re going to migrate from &lt;code>Shirt&lt;/code> to &lt;code>Product&lt;/code> is the heavy lifting. You might bounce ideas off ChatGPT, but ultimately it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to determine the right solution. It&amp;rsquo;s your job to make the decision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of tasks I haven&amp;rsquo;t automated at my job.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Translating Figma designs to data flow&lt;/strong>. Often the designs are complex, involving many moving parts and separate API calls. If it were obvious where the data should be fetched, frontend would be much simpler. Instead, you often end up with very complex frontend code because it&amp;rsquo;s not componentized properly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Technical design&lt;/strong>. There&amp;rsquo;s never one right answer. For any given problem, there might be 3 solutions I come up with, all with different pros and cons.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Making decisions&lt;/strong>. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve drafted the options, you have to pick one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Code review&lt;/strong>. I can only point out potential bugs because I understand enough about the data models and interactions among them. Most things caught in code review aren&amp;rsquo;t syntax issues; the build system would have already caught syntax issues early.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Reasoning about the system&lt;/strong>. Software engineers all know how to write code, so writing code is never the hard part. The hard part is knowing what code to write. Reasoning about all the ways the system can break is the challenge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Confirming your code solves the business problem&lt;/strong>. Ultimately, your job isn&amp;rsquo;t to write software because it&amp;rsquo;s fun but because it helps your employer create value.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There are more, but these are the ones that immediately come to mind. My job is mostly made up of these tasks that I can&amp;rsquo;t automate. I&amp;rsquo;m not opposed to using AI to help me automate them, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found so far the tools I&amp;rsquo;ve used aren&amp;rsquo;t sufficient for them. One way of interpreting this blog post is that AI is far from automating the job of a software engineer. Another way is seeing it as a list of problems that would be exciting to solve.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>[0] At the Big Company I work for, there&amp;rsquo;re very specific ways of doing certain things, but Copilot can more or less infer based on the files I
have open in my editor, even though we&amp;rsquo;re not using public libraries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[1] If you don&amp;rsquo;t find it relatable, I&amp;rsquo;m surprised and also curious to hear about your experience. Perhaps the example provided is too simple, but the shape of the problem is common based on conversations I&amp;rsquo;ve had with my friends at other companies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[2] You might ask, how did it make sense at the time to keep adding these properties to the model? There are a couple plausible explanations. 1) Your shirt company was trying to move fast, and you ended up in this situation. 2) It was your developer&amp;rsquo;s first project, and they weren&amp;rsquo;t experienced enough to know better. In any case, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t help to dwell on why someone else wrote the code a certain way but focus on what you&amp;rsquo;re gonna do about and prevent it from happening in the future.&lt;/p></description><author>ronalds.vilcins@gmail.com (Ronalds Vilcins)</author><guid>/2023/06/03/aiautomatestheboringcode/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How I learned to ride a bike</title><link>/2023/05/19/rideabike/</link><description>&lt;h2 id="first-attempt">First attempt &lt;a href="#first-attempt" class="hash g">#&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When I was 8, my parents tried to teach me to ride a bike. I started with training wheels. One day, I fell off my bike (with training wheels), and the wound took a month to heal. I never rode that bike again.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="second-attempt">Second attempt &lt;a href="#second-attempt" class="hash g">#&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My freshman year of college, my friends and I were walking around campus at midnight. Specifcially, we were in between the Physical Sciences Building and Klarman Hall. This was 2018, when &lt;a href="https://www.ithaca.com/news/ithaca/update-lime-bike-leaves-ithaca-permanently/article_eba1365c-a67f-11ea-8109-f78b29df1be2.html">Lime Bike was still in Ithaca&lt;/a>. We spotted a bike on the sidewalk and decided to use it. If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with PSB, you know it&amp;rsquo;s on top of a hill, and my friends took turns riding up and down the hill. They came back to the sidewalk and told me it&amp;rsquo;s not that hard to ride a bike, so I gave it a shot (on the sidewalk, not the hill). I was able to steadily ride the bike for, a minute? But, it didn&amp;rsquo;t stick.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="third-attempt">Third attempt &lt;a href="#third-attempt" class="hash g">#&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Summer of 2019, I was in Beijing. My friends and I were in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wudaokou">Wudaokou&lt;/a>, and they wanted to bike to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_National_Stadium">Bird&amp;rsquo;s Nest&lt;/a>. To give you an idea of how long that would take, the distance is around 3 miles or 5 km. I was a little scared, but I figured I could learn along the way. My friends had trouble describing how to ride the bike to me, but if I didn&amp;rsquo;t figure it out, I would have been left behind. I kept trying to &amp;ldquo;balance while moving&amp;rdquo; as someone described it, and eventually I got the hang of it. And then I learned what everyone meant when they said you learn it once and never forget it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s how I learned to ride a bike the summer of 2019 in Beijing.&lt;/p></description><author>ronalds.vilcins@gmail.com (Ronalds Vilcins)</author><guid>/2023/05/19/rideabike/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>My favorite songs in Mandarin</title><link>/2023/05/17/favoritemandopopsongs/</link><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a firm believer that most people&amp;rsquo;s favorite songs were simply there for them at &lt;a href="/2023/05/14/timeplace20230514/">the right place and right time&lt;/a> in their lives.

&lt;p>I like singing this at karaoke as an adult because it reminds me of how simple things were when I was a kid, and it&amp;rsquo;s like, there&amp;rsquo;s no reason my life can&amp;rsquo;t be that simple now. That was also back when we had blackboards. Now they&amp;rsquo;re all dry erase.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I first heard &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3U2y2G316E">Robynn &amp;amp; Kendy&amp;rsquo;s cover&lt;/a> of this song on the third season of The Voice of China. When they transitioned to &amp;ldquo;Where is the Love&amp;rdquo; I thought it was one of the best auditions I&amp;rsquo;d ever seen on the show. I love the original too. It&amp;rsquo;s a classic.&lt;/p>

Grain of salt disclaimer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="documentation-as-a-project">Documentation as a project &lt;a href="#documentation-as-a-project" class="hash g">#&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Documentation is a never-ending project. The first questions you should ask with any project are: Do I need to do it? What value does it add? Applied to documentation, you can ask:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Does my tool &lt;em>need&lt;/em> good documentation?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What value does good documentation add to my tool?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t think the answers to these questions are obvious. There are a lot of tools in our lives we use simply because they&amp;rsquo;re the only option, not because they&amp;rsquo;re easy to use. If you&amp;rsquo;re the only provider of internet payments APIs in the market, maybe you&amp;rsquo;re okay with having subpar documentation, but you can quickly think of a few reasons to improve it:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>A young upstart might come around with better documentation, leading potential customers to choose them over you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can reduce go-live time for your customers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can establish trust with your customers and build relationships that compound over time as you develop new products.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>All this is to say I understand why some companies choose not to invest in improving their documentation, but the investment certainly makes sense for some.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="documentation-as-code">Documentation as code &lt;a href="#documentation-as-code" class="hash g">#&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My employer treats documentation with a similar rigor to code:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jhzc_/status/1658270046202781696">Documentation linting rules&lt;/a> catch spelling mistakes, broken links, common language style mistakes (passive voice, confusing words like &amp;ldquo;once&amp;rdquo;), missing glossary definitions (&amp;ldquo;webhook&amp;rdquo;), and more.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We think about the &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/information-architecture">information architecture&lt;/a> of our docs, like you might think of a system design architecture before writing code.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Documentation goes through technical writing review.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="documentation-as-a-value-add">Documentation as a value add &lt;a href="#documentation-as-a-value-add" class="hash g">#&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My employer is the first example people point to as an example of investment in documentation paying dividends over time. Having spent a lot of time reading our docs, there are a few things I can&amp;rsquo;t help but notice when I read the docs for other developer-focused projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Some projects &lt;strong>over-invest in feature docs and under-invest in solution docs&lt;/strong>. They describe what x is but not how to use it. People visit your docs with a goal in mind, and your mission is to help them achieve it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some people &lt;strong>brain dump&lt;/strong> when they write docs. Every doc needs a thesis statement to orient its direction. Only include details that advance the user towards that goal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Why use many word when few word do trick&lt;/strong>. Some docs could use editing for brevity. Reading convoluted sentences takes a toil on the tired developer&amp;rsquo;s mind. The easiest example is the words &amp;ldquo;very&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;really&amp;rdquo; [0].&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When &lt;strong>documentation is an after-thought&lt;/strong>, it&amp;rsquo;s apparent in the developer experience. If you don&amp;rsquo;t build your product ground up from the perspective of how a developer would use it, you notice when it&amp;rsquo;s hard to document. After all, documenting is just describing to a developer how they use your product.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of AI tools to summarize documentation on Twitter. While those tools are no doubt useful, I think there&amp;rsquo;s potential in tools to help &lt;em>write&lt;/em> documentation. I want to see an AI tool that takes a 20-step brain dump guide and converts it to a 5-step MVP tutorial.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to make documentation a differentiating point for your product, I think it&amp;rsquo;s first and foremost about the content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How do you know if the content is valuable? Read it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>AI can help you write and edit, but the ultimate test of your docs is if&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>A human understands them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A human can use your product to build something that generates value.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>That is, until AI can replace my job as a developer (I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s there quite yet).&lt;/p>

The goal was to create a kind of musical diary, a playlist for a specific time in my life. It&amp;rsquo;s fun to reflect on songs that you listen to, and the memories just all come back to you. This is something I&amp;rsquo;ve noted to myself in my head for a while, although I wish I&amp;rsquo;d started creating playlists earlier.&lt;/p>
