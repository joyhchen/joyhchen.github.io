          <p>Even though Mark Zuckerberg announced this challenge as his goal for 2015, I think his mission is universally applicable. A couple days ago I was browsing a Reddit thread for a Chinese documentary about factory life for migrant workers when I saw a book recommendation in the comments. A user had mentioned that Leslie T. Chang wrote an interesting book about the issue titled <em>Factory Girls</em>. Since spring break had just started for me and I had nothing else to do, I decided to read this book. Reading again made me realize how much I missed picking up a book I actually wanted to read. So, I resolved to start reading again, but I&#39;m tweaking Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s rules a bit. He mentioned reading a book every other week, amounting to 26 books in a 52-week year. My goal, like his, is to read 26 books this year (12 months starting from today March 27, 2016) but in a looser time frame, meaning I won&#39;t limit myself to every other week.</p>
