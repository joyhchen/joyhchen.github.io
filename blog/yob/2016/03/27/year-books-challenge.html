        <h2>Year of Books Challenge</h2>
        <p>Even though Mark Zuckerberg announced this challenge as his goal for 2015, I think his mission is universally applicable. A couple days ago I was browsing a Reddit thread for a Chinese documentary about factory life for migrant workers when I saw a book recommendation in the comments. A user had mentioned that Leslie T. Chang wrote an interesting book about the issue titled <em>Factory Girls</em>. Since spring break had just started for me and I had nothing else to do, I decided to read this book. Reading again made me realize how much I missed picking up a book I actually wanted to read. So, I resolved to start reading again, but I&#39;m tweaking Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s rules a bit. He mentioned reading a book every other week, amounting to 26 books in a 52-week year. My goal, like his, is to read 26 books this year (12 months starting from today March 27, 2016) but in a looser time frame, meaning I won&#39;t limit myself to every other week.</p>

<p>Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s primary goal was to increase his awareness of the world through exposure to various cultures, languages, and experiences in general. While I am also interested in increasing my consciousness of where I stand in the world, I hope that reading can contribute to my development as a writer as well.</p>

<p>The problem with long commitments like this is that it&#39;s hard to stay focused. I think the primary reason my development has been slow is the fact that I&#39;m easily distracted. It&#39;s easy to jump on to the newest technology and abandon it a week later. So, I guess the last thing I hope this challenge can teach me is discipline. Making a plan and sticking to the course appears simple yet when put in action feels tiring.</p>
